# Humor-Detection-using-ColBert-Data
#Introduction

Humor is a exceptionally complex characteristic concept which characterizes human beings and social substances.  Humor is an fundamental component in individual communication.  Because of its subjective nature,finding the structures behind humor, recognize humor and extraction of humor remains a challenge.Humor includes data related to linguistic, psy-chological, neurological and sociological com-ponents. For instance, cognitive aspects as wellas social information are some of the factorsthat should be analyzed in order to understand humor properties.

#Data

The dataset employed for the detection of Humor isthe ”ColBERT Dataset” which consists of 200k labeled short texts distinguished between humor and non-humor. News dataset includes 200,853 newsheadlines. Headlines are extracted from categories including politics, wellness, entertainment and parenting. Jokes dataset contains 231,657 jokes/humor short texts taken from Reddit communities.

BERT Model :

BERT is acronym for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT is a model that is used to represent text.  For a given input statement to have a deeper sense of context, BERT employs bidirectional training and vector represen-tations are created for each word as the output.

Naive Bayes: 

Naive Bayes Classifier is simple and effective classification algorithm which helps in building fast machine learning models with quick predictions.

Random Forest : 

It is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes majority vote for classification and average in case of regression. Random Forest Algorithm handles the data set containing continuous variables in the case of regression
and categorical variables in the case of classification. It performs better for classification problems.

#Evaluation Parameters

Precision : The ability of a classification model toidentify the relevant data points.Precision is num-ber of true positives divided by the number of truepositives plus the number of false positives.

Recall: Ability of a model to find all the relevantcases within a data set.  Recall is defined as thenumber of true positives divided by the number oftrue positives plus the number of false negatives.

F1  score  :  F1  Score  is  the  weighted  averageof Precision and Recall.  
F1 Score = 2*(Recall *Precision) / (Recall + Precision)

Accuracy:  Accuracy is the performance mea-sure and it is simply a ratio of correctly predictedobservation to the total number of observations



We are using Colbert Data which are uploaded in the project as Humor_Train_Data.csv and Humor_CorrectEstimation_Data.csv


The project is done in Google Collabaration, below are the steps to execute the code in Google Colab.


Downlaod the Team2_Humor_Detection.ipynb file along with two data files.


Upload the train and test files into your drive.


Open Google collaberator(https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) in chrome and click on upload button on the screen. Else navigate to "File" and click on "Upload Notebook".


Select the downloded Team2_Humor_Detection.ipynb file.


Navigate to Runtime and click on "Change Runtime Type" to "GPU".

Copy the shareable link from google drive daatasets.

Right click on each dataset and goto shareable link, copy whole part and remove excess as shown below in image.
uploaded and paste it in the code.

#Conclusion
There is a lot of demand for automatic humor detecting systems in the market as it can be used in chat-bots and AI.We still consider that detecting someone’s sense of humor is a difficult problem. As with humor, all these figures of speech depends on the listener or reader to be in on this context.  The results are highly dependent on the datasets utilized and thus high quality of the datasets will lead to more precise results.
